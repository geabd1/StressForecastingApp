# StressForcastingApp
## Background / Idea
Stress is a major factor affecting students’ and adults’ health, productivity, and quality of life.  
Recent research shows that LSTM neural networks can forecast tomorrow’s stress levels (≈81–83% accuracy) from passive phone and wearable data.  
Separately, MIT Media Lab work showed that “companion-like” robots delivering positive psychology activities improved users’ well-being and readiness to change.

This project combines these two strands:  
* Use wearable/phone data to forecast daily stress.  
* Provide supportive positive psychology interventions through a friendly robot or app.  

## Objective of the Presentation
Introduce attendees to this combined approach—showing how machine learning and human-robot interaction can work together to forecast and reduce stress.

## What Attendees Will Learn
- How stress can be forecast from multi-modal passive data.
- Differences between coach-like vs. companion-like robots for mental health support.
- A conceptual design of an integrated system that predicts stress and offers timely positive psychology exercises.
- Key challenges (privacy, data quality, user trust, maintaining engagement).
